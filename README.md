# Ensemble Machine Learning Techniques [Video]
This is the code repository for [Ensemble Machine Learning Techniques [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/ensemble-machine-learning-techniques-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788392716), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Ensemble is a powerful way to upgrade your model as it combines models and doesn't assume a single model is the most accurate. But what if we combine these models as a way to drop those limitations to produce a much more powerful classifier or regressor?

This course will show you how to combine various models to achieve higher accuracy than base models can. This has been the case in various contests such as Netflix and Kaggle, where the winning solutions used ensemble methods.

If you want more than a superficial look at machine learning models and wish to build reliable models, then this course is for you.
